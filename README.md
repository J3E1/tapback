## Note from the Author

This is a side project and not a commercial offering. I built TapBack to experiment with Next.js, Prisma, and other technologies. It is free to use, but I do not guarantee any support or maintenance. Please keep in mind that it may contain bugs and might not include all features that you would expect from a commercial product. If you find it useful, please star the repository.
